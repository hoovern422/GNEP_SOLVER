# GNEP_SOLVER:
Python code implementing an actor-critic algorithm for solving n-player generalized Nash equilibrium problems. The examples each "problem_.py" file solves can be found in the sample_problems folder (in progress).

# Requirements:
1. Tensorflow/ Tensorflow GPU
2. Tensorflow Probability
3. Numpy
4. Scipy
5. Matplotlib

# Running the prgoram:
in the root directory type 'python problem_.py' for a problem specific file.
